text: As the Senate president, the vice president presides over its deliberations (or delegates this task to a member of the Senate), but is allowed to vote only when it is necessary to break a tie. While this vote-casting prerogative has been exercised chiefly on legislative issues, it has also been used to break ties on the election of Senate officers, as well as on the appointment of Senate committees. In this capacity, the vice president also presides over joint sessions of Congress.
question: is the vice president the head of the senate
answer: 
The vice president is not the head of the Senate in the same way that a president is the head of an organization. However, the vice president does preside over Senate deliberations and has the power to cast a vote when necessary to break a tie. This role is distinct from the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government, and is a product of the unique structure of the United States Senate. Therefore, the answer to the question is: The vice president is not the head of the Senate in the same way that a president is the head of an organization, but does preside over its deliberations and has the power to cast a vote when necessary to break a tie."

text: The Federal Reserve began taking high-denomination currency out of circulation (destroying large bills received by banks) in 1969. As of May 30, 2009, only 336 $10,000 bills were known to exist; 342 remaining $5,000 bills; and 165,372 remaining $1,000 bills. Due to their rarity, collectors often pay considerably more than the face value of the bills to acquire them. Some are in museums in other parts of the world.
question: can i get $1 000 bill from the bank
answer: 
False. The statement says that as of May 30, 2009, there were 165,372 remaining $1,000 bills. However, it does not mean that you can get one from the bank. The text suggests that the remaining $1,000 bills are held by collectors and are not in circulation."

text: On the outbreak of war, the Confederates seized many of the state's army camps, though the Union retained control of the main seaports. There was little fighting in Florida, the only major conflict being the Battle of Olustee near Lake City in February 1864. However, wartime conditions made it easier for slaves to escape, and many of them became useful informers to Union commanders. As southern morale suffered, deserters from both sides took refuge in Florida, often attacking Confederate units and looting farms. In May 1865, Federal control was re-established, slavery abolished, and the state governor John Milton shot himself, rather than submit to Union occupation.
question: were any civil war battles fought in florida
answer: 
The text mentions the Battle of Olustee, which took place in February 1864, so the answer is ""yes."" However, it's important to note that the text also mentions that there was ""little fighting in Florida,"" so while the Battle of Olustee was significant, it was not the only battle fought in the state during the Civil War. Other battles, such as the Battle of Natural Bridge and the Battle of Pocotaligo, also took place in Florida."

text: The ground squirrels are members of the squirrel family of rodents (Sciuridae) which generally live on or in the ground, rather than trees. The term is most often used for the medium-sized ground squirrels, as the larger ones are more commonly known as marmots (genus Marmota) or prairie dogs, while the smaller and less bushy-tailed ground squirrels tend to be known as chipmunks. Together, they make up the ``marmot tribe'' of squirrels, Marmotini, and the large and mainly ground squirrel subfamily Xerinae, and containing six living genera. Well-known members of this largely Holarctic group are the marmots (Marmota), including the American groundhog, the chipmunks, the susliks (Spermophilus), and the prairie dogs (Cynomys). They are highly variable in size and habitus, but most are remarkably able to rise up on their hind legs and stand fully erect comfortably for prolonged periods. They also tend to be far more gregarious than other squirrels, and many live in colonies with complex social structures. Most Marmotini are rather short-tailed and large squirrels, and the alpine marmot (Marmota marmota) is the largest living member of the Sciuridae, at 53--73 cm in length and weighing 5--8 kg.
question: is a chipmunk the same as a ground squirrel
answer: 
False. Chipmunks are a type of ground squirrel, but they are not the same species. Chipmunks are a specific genus within the larger group of ground squirrels, which also includes marmots, susliks, and prairie dogs. Chipmunks are typically smaller and have bushier tails than other ground squirrels, and they tend to live in burrows rather than in colonies. The misconception that chipmunks and ground squirrels are the same animal may arise from the fact that both are types of squirrels that live on the ground, but they have distinct characteristics and behaviors."

text: Compared to similar technology in other sports, goal-line technology is a relatively recent addition to association football; its integration having been opposed by the sport's authorities. In July 2012, the International Football Association Board (IFAB) officially approved the use of goal line technology, amending the Laws of the Game to permit (but not require) its use. Due to its expense, goal-line technology is only used at the highest levels of the game. Goal-line technology is currently used in the top European domestic leagues, and at major international competitions such as the 2014 Men's, 2018 Men's and 2015 Women's FIFA World Cups.

text: Baby back ribs (also back ribs or loin ribs) are taken from the top of the rib cage between the spine and the spare ribs, below the loin muscle. They have meat between the bones and on top of the bones, and are shorter, curved, and sometimes meatier than spare ribs. The rack is shorter at one end, due to the natural tapering of a pig's rib cage. The shortest bones are typically only about 3 in (7.6 cm) and the longest is usually about 6 in (15 cm), depending on the size of the hog. A pig side has 15 to 16 ribs (depending on the breed), but usually two or three are left on the shoulder when it is separated from the loin. So, a rack of back ribs contains a minimum of eight ribs (some may be trimmed if damaged), but can include up to 13 ribs, depending on how it has been prepared by the butcher. A typical commercial rack has 10--13 bones. If fewer than 10 bones are present, butchers call them ``cheater racks''.
question: are back ribs same as baby back ribs
answer: 
False. Back ribs and baby back ribs come from different parts of the pig. Back ribs are taken from the top of the rib cage between the spine and the spare ribs, while baby back ribs are taken from the same area but below the loin muscle. This means that baby back ribs are shorter, curved, and sometimes meatier than back ribs. The number of ribs in a rack of baby back ribs can vary, but it typically contains 10--13 bones, while a rack of back ribs may contain fewer than 10 bones and is referred to as a ""cheater rack""."

text: The climate in the region is generally cool, owing to the southern latitude. There are no weather stations in the group of islands including Cape Horn; but a study in 1882--1883, found an annual rainfall of 1,357 millimetres (53.4 inches), with an average annual temperature of 5.2 °C (41.4 °F).

text: The away goals rule is applied in many football competitions that involve two-leg fixtures, including the knockout stages of the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, CAF Champions League, CAF Confederation Cup and any two-legged playoffs in qualification for the FIFA World Cup or European Championships.
