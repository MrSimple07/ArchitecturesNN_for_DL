is a chipmunk the same as a ground squirrel,False,"The ground squirrels are members of the squirrel family of rodents (Sciuridae) which generally live on or in the ground, rather than trees. The term is most often used for the medium-sized ground squirrels, as the larger ones are more commonly known as marmots (genus Marmota) or prairie dogs, while the smaller and less bushy-tailed ground squirrels tend to be known as chipmunks. Together, they make up the ``marmot tribe'' of squirrels, Marmotini, and the large and mainly ground squirrel subfamily Xerinae, and containing six living genera. Well-known members of this largely Holarctic group are the marmots (Marmota), including the American groundhog, the chipmunks, the susliks (Spermophilus), and the prairie dogs (Cynomys). They are highly variable in size and habitus, but most are remarkably able to rise up on their hind legs and stand fully erect comfortably for prolonged periods. They also tend to be far more gregarious than other squirrels, and many live in colonies with complex social structures.

are back ribs same as baby back ribs,True,"Baby back ribs (also back ribs or loin ribs) are taken from the top of the rib cage between the spine and the spare ribs, below the loin muscle. They have meat between the bones and on top of the bones, and are shorter, curved, and sometimes meatier than spare ribs. The rack is shorter at one end, due to the natural tapering of a pig's rib cage. The shortest bones are typically only about 3 in (7.6 cm) and the longest is usually about 6 in (15 cm), depending on the size of the hog. A pig side has 15 to 16 ribs (depending on the breed), but usually two or three are left on the shoulder when it is separated from the loin. So, a rack of back ribs contains a minimum of eight ribs (some may be trimmed if damaged), but can include up to 13 ribs, depending on how it has been prepared by the butcher. A typical commercial rack has 10--13 bones. If fewer than 10 bones are present, butchers call them ``cheater racks''.","Answer only ""true"" or ""false"" according to the question and text.

do you need a permit to carry a gun in nh,False,"Since 22 February 2017, New Hampshire is a constitutional carry state, requiring no license to open carry or concealed carry a firearm in public. Concealed carry permits are still issued for purposes of reciprocity with other states.","Answer only ""true"" or ""false"" according to the question and text.

text: Since 22 February 2017, New Hampshire is a constitutional carry state, requiring no license to open carry or concealed carry a firearm in public. Concealed carry permits are still issued for purposes of reciprocity with other states.
question: do you need a permit to carry a gun in nh
answer: 
False

The text describes that open carry is permitted without a permit, and concealed carry may still be done with a permit as the last sentence states. Therefore, under these conditions it is false to say that a permit is needed to carry a gun in New Hampshire.



Additional Information: 

New Hampshire laws regarding firearms are found in the New Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated (RSA). Chapter 193 deals with various firearms-related provisions.

New Hampshire is considered a ""shall issue"" state for issuing concealed carry permits. The state requires a permit to carry a concealed firearm, even for residents (RSA 193-A:1). However, the text is correct in stating that New Hampshire does not require a permit to openly carry a firearm.

As the text states, a valid New Hampshire concealed carry permit may be used for reciprocity in other states (RSA 193-A:14).

The text's last sentence ""concealed carry permits are still issued for purposes of reciprocity with other states"" is technically correct but it can be misleading. It does not imply that carrying a concealed firearm in New Hampshire without a permit is legal, but rather it is allowed only for the purpose of reciprocity when traveling to other states.","text: Since 22 February 2017, New Hampshire is a constitutional carry state, requiring no license to open carry or concealed carry a firearm in public.
