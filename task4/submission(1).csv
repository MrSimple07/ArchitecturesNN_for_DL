3. Use a thermal break: A thermal break is a layer of insulation that separates the heated space from the cold ground. This can be achieved by using a layer of insulation between the subfloor and the floor covering.

4. Choose the right floor covering: Some floor coverings are more insulating than others. For example, carpets can provide insulation, while hardwood floors can be less insulating.

5. Use a radiant heating system: A radiant heating system can be more efficient than forced air heating systems, as it heats the floor directly, reducing heat loss through the floor.
